This version of SimianGrid has two index.php files in the Grid folder.
One of them is named "local.php" and it is meant to be used with
mod_rewrite to restrict the ip addresses that can connect to it using
htaccess directives.  local.php uses every lib/Class.* file and should be used
for the local grid.  using mod_rewrite to redirect the index.php call to login.php
allows for greater control and security of the grid as the correct mod_rewrite
directives can restrict access to local.php to only selected IP addresses.

The index.php index.php uses the GridPublic/lib folder for access to functions.
Only those functions required for local and hypergrid access are available.
This index.php is also modified to stop DELETE calls from executing.


The purpose of this setup is to allow for HG authentication and services to proceed
while blocking random region servers from making unauthorized local connections
to the grid.
